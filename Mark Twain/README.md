# Mark Twain

In this project I will merge 4 Mark Twain books through the gutenbergr library in R. After merging the books, I will filter out the stop words and tokenize all text. Using this information I will gain a better understanding in words and trends Mark Twain used more frequently when writing his books.

Here is a link to my medium article teaching readers how to tokenize - [Mark Twain Tokenizing](https://towardsdatascience.com/text-analytics-in-r-ae23df8ee928?source=your_stories_page---------------------------)
