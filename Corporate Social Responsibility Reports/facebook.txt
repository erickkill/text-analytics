Sustainability
Overview
Our mission
Facebook’s mission is to give people the
power to build community and bring the
world closer together.
We believe
We believe sustainability is about more than operating
responsibly. It’s an opportunity to support the
communities we’re a part of and make a bigger impact on
the world.
That’s why we’re working to minimize the impact of
our energy, emissions and water usage, protect workers
and the environment in our supply chain, and partner
with others to develop and share solutions for a more
sustainable world. 
Facebook is
committed to
fighting climate
change.
We’ve set a science-based target to reduce
our GHG emissions 75% in 2020. Our goal
is to have a positive impact on the world by
designing, building, and operating sustainably.

Climate Action
We’re doing our part to fulfill the spirit of The Paris
Agreement. Facebook is an active supporter of the We
Are Still In coalition and we are constantly innovating to
minimize our environmental impact.
In 2018, we achieved a 44% reduction in GHG emissions
from 2017 levels and are more than halfway to our 75%
goal.
This is equivalent to 265,000 metric tons of CO2e or
56,000 passenger cars taken off the road for one year.
Renewable Energy
Facebook was one of the first to commit to
supporting our facilities with 100 percent
renewable energy back in 2011. In 2018, our
operations achieved 75% renewable energy
and we are on track to meet 100% in 2020.
Our data centers are among the most energyefficient facilities in the world. For each new
data center Facebook builds, we add new
renewable energy to the same electric grid as
our facilities and we do it in a way that often
increases options for other businesses in those
communities. Today, we are one of the largest
renewable energy purchasers in the world.
Water Stewardship
At Facebook, we believe every drop matters. We
prioritize water stewardship across our operations
and our facilities are among the most water-efficient
in the world.
We’re committed to creating circular systems that
reuse water as much as possible. Our data centers
are 80% more water-efficient than the average
data center.
1.5b
gallons of water avoided
in 2018 alone, that’s the
equivalent of
18.5 million bathtubs

Sustainability in numbers
Facebook is committed to minimizing the impact of our energy, emissions and water usage —and we’re using robust sustainability data to do it.
Tracking and minimizing impact for millions of square feet across the globe
We’re scaling positive impact by tracking metrics that matter. By employing a data-driven approach, we’re able to identify and build on our most impactful programs and highlight new places to drive efficiency. We’re tracking key performance indicators to give us detailed insight into our carbon footprint and our energy and water use.

ENERGY
Increasing our use of renewable energy sources to 100% in 2020.
We’re working aggressively to support our facilities with 100% renewable energy in 2020. Facebook has contracted for over 4.0 gigawatts of renewable energy, making us the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world. In 2018, we achieved 75% renewable energy, and are on track to meet our goal in 2020.

ELECTRICITY MIX
Renewable energy made up over 75% of our overall electricity mix in 2018. We have steadily increased our renewable energy since 2013 on our pathway to 100% in 2020

Show data table
Using Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) to measure how efficiently our data centers convert energy into compute power.
PUE is how we measure the operating efficiency of our data centers. We compare the total amount of power we source from our utility with the power used to run the hardware within the data center. The “ideal” PUE is 1.0, meaning that every electron entering the site is used to power the hardware inside the data center. The industry average PUE is 1.5, and we’re proud that our facilities have averaged 1.11 or below for the last five years. We still continue to look for additional ways to get even closer to 1.0.

Annual Data Center Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)
Continuous optimizations are keeping our PUE well below the industry average

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
Setting a science-based target to reduce our emissions by 75%.
As part of our commitment to fight climate change, we've set a science-based target to reduce our operational (Scope 1 + 2) greenhouse gas emissions 75% in 2020 from 2017 levels. We've made great progress towards that target - in 2018, our emissions were 44% less than in 2017, despite growth in our business. We’re minimizing our carbon footprint by driving operating efficiencies across our facilities and sourcing 100% renewable energy for our operations.

ANNUAL MARKET-BASED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
Facebook’s annual emissions for the average person on the platform are less than the carbon impact of making one cup of black coffee.

Show data table
Fighting climate change to make a positive global impact.
In addition to reducing our direct emissions and procuring 100% renewable electricity, we're thinking about how to have a positive impact on climate change through our supply chain and broader engagement. We've analyzed our value chain footprint to prioritize efforts to mitigate emissions from activities like business travel and impacts from materials in our buildings and hardware.

WATER
Leading with data centers that are 80% more water efficient than average.
Our data centers are among the most water-efficient in the world. We’ve optimized our water use to achieve exceptional efficiency, but we’re also making sure that we get more out every drop we use.

ANNUAL WATER WITHDRAWAL
We use water to keep our data centers cool and to keep our offices running smoothly.

Show data table
Transparent about our water data and always looking for the best ways to communicate our impact.
We’ve measured our water withdrawal for years but recently we’ve started reporting our consumption too. Water withdrawal as a metric tells us how much water we purchase for our operations, but a large amount of that water is returned to local wastewater treatment plants and can be used again further downstream. Water consumption tells us what we actually evaporate in our operations and gives us a better idea of our true impact.

Measuring how efficiently our data centers use water
Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) is a water efficiency metric that compares the amount of water we use to the amount of energy that’s used by our hardware. We’ve consistently kept our WUE stable—and extremely low—since we began tracking and reporting the metric in 2012. We’re also proud that we were the first to report this metric publicly and are still one of the few companies to share it.

Water usage effectiveness (WUE)
Our data centers use 80% less water than typical data centers.

COLLABORATION FOR GOOD
Supply chain
Industry collaboration
By removing any material that does not serve a purpose
For our data center hardware, we eliminate nearly six pounds of material per server.
Facebook’s mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. We understand the urgency of climate change and are committed to help tackle this pressing global challenge. But climate change is too big for any of us to solve alone. That’s why we partner with diverse organizations to support our communities and catalyze climate action around the world.

Together, we’re doing our part to fulfill the spirit of the Paris climate agreement through our support of H.R. 9 (Climate Action Now Act) and our commitment to the We Are Still In coalition. As we develop new and innovative solutions to address the impacts of climate change, we’re proud that our platform can rally people around this issue. Our collaboration with The United Nations, one of our key partners, demonstrates the potential for Facebook’s platforms to serve as powerful tools to generate support for climate action. We’ve hosted Facebook Live studios at the UN Climate Change Conventions since 2016 and the People’s Seat campaign on Facebook and Instagram reached heads of state and over 1 billion people. In 2018, The United Nation’s ActNow Messenger bot fostered over 100,000 actions.

Whether we’re collaborating to find solutions that connect more people across the world, protecting workers in our supply chain, or providing a platform for open source innovation in technology, we’re on a mission to bring people together.

Upholding values globally
Our company is growing—and that includes our supply chain. We’re working closely with our suppliers and partners to protect workers and the environment throughout our global supply chain.
