#TwitterForGood
2018 Global Report


Twitter’s second #TwitterForGood Annual Report reflects the growing and compelling
impact that Twitter and our global network of community partners had in 2018. Our
corporate philanthropy mission is to reflect and augment the positive power of our
platform. We perform our philanthropic work through active civic engagement, employee
volunteerism, charitable contributions, and in-kind donations, such as through our
#DataForGood and #AdsForGood programs. In these ways, Twitter seeks to foster
greater understanding, equality, and opportunity in the communities where we operate.
Employee Charity Matching Program
This past year, we broke new ground by implementing our Employee Charity Matching
Program. This program avails Twitter employees of the opportunity to support our
#TwitterForGood work by matching donations they make to our charity partners around
the world. After it was launched in August 2018, Twitter employees donated US$195K to
189 charities around the world. We look forward to expanding this new program in 2019
by garnering greater employee participation and including additional eligible charities.
@NeighborNest
This year, our signature philanthropic initiative – our community tech lab called the
@NeighborNest – was recognized by the Mutual of America Foundation. The Foundation
awarded Twitter and Compass Family Services, one of our local community partners,
with the 2018 Community Partnership Award. This is one of the top philanthropic awards
in the U.S., recognizing community impact by an NGO/private sector partnership.
Since opening in 2015, we’ve conducted over 4,000 hours of programming and
welcomed over 15,000 visits from the community. This was made possible in partnership
with over 10 key nonprofit partners, nearly 900 unique visits from Twitter volunteers, and
over 1,400 hours of volunteer service.
A cousin of the @NeighborNest operates @TwitterDublin. The #ImpactNest was set up by
a group of Twitter employees to support local start-ups engaged in social
entrepreneurship. The #ImpactNest’s initiatives and events grew over the last year and
we aim to continue and expand its activities in 2019.
I am delighted to share the Public Policy team’s second global #TwitterForGood End of
Year Report. I am especially pleased it captures the many impactful initiatives and special
moments we shared through Twitter over the last year. We look forward to driving even
greater impact in 2019.

Executive Summary
#TwitterForGood
To advance our philanthropic goals, we utilize the power of the Twitter platform, harness
insights from Twitter data, and tap the talents and interests of our employees to drive
meaningful impact in the communities in which we operate.
Our corporate philanthropy efforts are focused where we can have direct impact on
issues of importance to our communities and people who use Twitter. Our areas of focus
are:  

1. Online Safety and Health – We seek to educate users, and especially youth, about
healthy digital citizenship, online safety, and media literacy. We have been working
on programs aimed at empowering our users to build their critical thinking and
connecting them to resources in order to give them control over their online
experience.
2. Freedom of Expression and Civil Liberties – We support initiatives that defend
and respect the user’s voice, promote free expression and defend civil liberties.
3. Equality – We support equality and universal acceptance for all people. As part of
this commitment we work with organizations to ensure equal opportunities in STEM
and computer science programs for women and underrepresented minorities of all
ages.
4. Internet Access and Adoption – We seek to overcome the digital divide by
supporting technological literacy and access initiatives in the countries we serve.
5. Emergency Response and Disaster Relief – When emergencies or natural
disasters strike, we offer tools and programs to assist first responders and relief
organizations in saving lives.
Besides these, we also fuel philanthropic efforts globally by working with our
communities. We work with charities and NGOs to help them utilize the Twitter platform
effectively, support them through our #AdsForGood program, connect them to our
volunteers, and much more.

Corporate Volunteerism
Our #TwitterForGood volunteer program is a Twitter tradition when twice yearly our
employees take time out of their daily routines at the office to get out into the community
to assist in service projects. Outside of San Francisco, we speak of #TwitterForGood
days of volunteer service that can occur at different times of the year for employees in
our offices around the world. This global commitment to serving in the communities in
which we operate yields important benefits for both our community partners and Twitter
volunteers as we learn from each other and grow together.
In 2018, each of our global days of service involved projects across 25 offices around the
world, over 1,300 Twitter volunteers, and 3,900 hours of service in partnership with over
75 nonprofits. We published a Moment for the Spring and Fall activities from
@TwitterForGood, and two blogs: "#TwitterForGood Day Spring 2018" and
"#TwitterForGood Day Fall 2018" to recap the day.

#AdsForGood
#AdsForGood is #TwitterForGood’s pro
bono advertising program. We provide free
advertising credits to qualifying charity
partners working in our philanthropic focus
areas.
In 2018, we worked with over 200
organizations globally and extended the
equivalent of US $2.6 million in pro bono
advertising credits. This includes USD
$900K granted through our new
#CampaignsForChange program.  

The #CampaignsForChange program is a
new collaboration in 2018 among internal
Twitter teams and provides higher pro bono
grant amounts for larger philanthropic
initiatives that seek to maximize their reach
and impact.

In August 2018, we started our Employee
Charity Matching Program. Twitter now
matches monetary donations to eligible
nonprofits around the world up to $2,000
USD a year per employee. Eligible nonprofits are those working on the five core areas of
our corporate philanthropy. In addition, we also include in this program our charity
partners with whom we have ongoing volunteer partnerships for community service, and
others whose cause reflect a special need in the local community where we operate.   
Financial Grants
The @NeighborNest and the #ImpactNest
At our US and international HQ locations, we have our signature philanthropic initiatives
the Neighbor Nest and the #ImpactNest. Since 2015, we have approached the Tenderloin
community in San Francisco through our tech lab called the @NeighborNest. Its mission
is to create new possibilities by cultivating digital literacy and connecting Twitter
volunteers, partner organizations, and their clients.
At our international HQ in Dublin, we have a similar program since 2017, the
#ImpactNest. The #ImpactNest was set up by a group of Twitter employees with the
purpose to inspire and support the new generation of local start-ups engaged in social
entrepreneurship.
We hope you enjoy this compilation of our 2018 @TwitterForGood initiatives.

#NestFest
We turned 3! And celebrated online and in person with a special family movie night with
Twitter employees and community partners. We also created a Moment from
@NeighborNest and a video highlighting the Nest’s programs throughout the year.
What @NeighborNest visitors are
saying:
“It's a program with a lot of benefits
for families to have knowledge and
learn about technology and safety
on a computer or cell phone.” –
NeighborNest client.
“Starting out as a homeless family with an
infant son, I have used the Nest to become
stable in my housing, parenting and so many
other parts of my life. I value the Nest in my
life.” – NeighborNest client.
“Volunteering at the Nest is a great dose of
perspective. We work with relative experts in
computers at Twitter, so it's important to
recognize that not everyone has those skills,
and even more important to try to bridge the
digital divide.” – Twitter volunteer.
