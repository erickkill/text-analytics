# Tokenizing Tweets, January 2020

In this project I will use Twitter's APi in R to oull tweets directly focused on the US, Europe and Asia Economies. Using tokenization I will se if there are any relationships with keywords being searched. The goal is to spot trends in twitter.

Here is a link to my [Rpubs documentation](https://rpubs.com/jasonmchlee/tokenizingtweets)
